 * PHS_CFG_SIR_LOCKOUT_TIMER is used for handling a lockout timer for SIR. 
 * The lockut timer is used to protect against denial of service 
 * attacks. The timer is turned om when a SIR arrives and can be handled
 * sucessfully. All other SIR that arrives when the timer is set will 
 * be discarded. The timer is turned of and SIR can be handled again
 * after one of the following cases:
 * - When the connection has been established 
 * - If the user answers the dialog followed after an SIR with cancel 
 *   (then the connection will never be established)
 * - If the timer expires.
 *
 * PHS_CFG_SIR_LOCKOUT_TIMER defines how long the 
 * lockout timer should be on. The value should be given
 * in 1/10ths of a second
 *
 * If this behavior is not requried set the value to 0,
 * and no lockout tmer will be used
